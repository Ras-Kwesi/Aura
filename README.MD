# Aora

## Overview

**Aora** is a React Native application designed for personal learning and development. The app provides a platform to share AI generated videos. This project was built using **Expo** and leverages various libraries and tools to create a seamless user experience across Android, iOS, and web platforms.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Android, iOS, and the web using Expo.
- **React Navigation**: Smooth and intuitive navigation across screens.
- **Audio Integration**: Play meditation tracks using `expo-av`.
- **Customizable UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS using `nativewind`.
- **Animations**: Enhanced user experience with `react-native-reanimated`.
- **Safe Area Handling**: Ensures proper layout across devices using `react-native-safe-area-context`.

## Installation
